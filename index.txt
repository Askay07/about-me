Avishek  - Section 01, Dr. Case (11:00 am)

Hello everyone, my name is Avishek Khadka and I am a junior working on my BS in Computer Science. 

My hometown is in Kathmandu, Nepal and I have been studying in the United States since 2017. My hobbies are watching movies and travelling. I completed my high school back in Nepal and I do not have much experience working in the Computer Science field. 

My future plan for right now is to complete my Masters Degree and work somewhere in the iOS field. I also plan to someday start something of my own  because creating new things is the purpose of living life in my opinion. 

Something interesting thing about me is that I do Stocks and Bonds trading in my free time. The link to my LinkedIn profile is : https://www.linkedin.com/in/avishek-khadka-063466171/
